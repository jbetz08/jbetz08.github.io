        <p class="purpose">The purpose of this site is to continually update website specifications as our client asks throughout 
            the semester. Every week our client will ask for additional concepts from the course to be added to our weather website.
            I want to provide a consistent frame for great user experience. I want the website to look clean, and to be easy to 
            navigate. I don't want to leave the user with any sort of doubt about how to use my site.
