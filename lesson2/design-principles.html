            <p>I like how this page takes into account the Rule of Thirds, 
                even for the mobile view they cover 2/3 of the screen with an
                example photo. You can swipe through and it is really aesthetically
                pleasing.

            <p>This website has aesthetically pleasing line spacing, margin spacing,
                and paragraph spacing. It makes it feel like the content is actually 
                valuable and that there is room for the content.

            <p>I deal with this principle everyday. I use spotify all the time
                and when you think about this principle with apps you use all the 
                time, it really starts to make sense. The play button is the 
                button I want to press ALL the time.
